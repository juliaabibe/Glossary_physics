\newglossaryentry(kinetic energy)
(
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of kinetic energy that an object has depends upon two variables: the mass (m) of the object and the speed (v) of the object. 
$$KE=/frac{m/tiemsv^2}{2}$$
This equation reveals that the kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to the square of its speed.Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity; it does not have a direction. The standard metric unit of measurement for kinetic energy is the Joule $J=/frac{kg/timesm^2}{s^2}$.
