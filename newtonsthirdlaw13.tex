(
According to Newton, whenever two objects interact with each other, they exert forces upon each other, which are called action and reaction forces. It is possible to state that Newton's third law is: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object. Therefore, according to Newton's thrid law forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.
